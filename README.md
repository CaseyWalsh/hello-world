# hello-world
Initial GitHub Tutorial.
========================

Hello people with a keen interest in my daily activities.  Project 'hello-world' is the exposed text-based interface to 'Geo Teral', a top-secret chat-bot AI enging that has passed ALL Touring tests thrown at it since relese 3.14.15.9 (over 250k unique 'challenge sessions' and counting).  For various platform-specific GUI interfaces, see my 'glass-canon' project (presently in Beta for Win 7 - 10, iOS, modern Android, modern Linux, and a few others).
